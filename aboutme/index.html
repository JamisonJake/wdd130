    <h2>Jake Jamison</h2>
    <p>I am a 22 year old from Rexburg Idaho, I am studying CIT and Automotive Tech.
    <p>I love all things tech and interactive entertainment.</p>
    <p>I collect physical media as a hobby. Mostly movies and games from the past and present.</p>
    <p>I just finished a job at Microsoft, I was working in the datacenter where I was fixing the server and networking hardware.</p>
    <p>I have no idea why my image is not working, if anyone knows I would appreciate the advice!</p>
